# Ramadan Iftari and Sehri Timer

To use the timer you have to be in my city(Kichha, Uttarakhand, India) üòÅ Jokes apart change the data variable in script.js in order to set current times for your city(Take help from GPT for data formatting).

I have not used any API because I didn't find one which was giving the correct sehri and iftar times according to my city. If you find one that does the job you can use get times from the API instead of manually setting them in the source code.


I acknowledge that there is much scope for improvement.
